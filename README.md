# Unity Day/Night Cycle With baked Lightmaps

I created this system for my game [Boat Blitz](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.novalabs.bb&pcampaignid=web_share). 
With this system you can switch between day and night with baked lightmaps in your scene. I also 
took help from [Prefab Light mapping](https://github.com/Ayfel/PrefabLightmapping) repo to bake light 
on each prefab.
- You will need two different `Global Volume` for night and day. System will cycle between them. 
- You will need to bake light map for day and night with different light sources for day and night. The system 
will cycle between them.
- You can cycle material of different objects too. To make the switch more genuine.
